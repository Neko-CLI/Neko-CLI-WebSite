                    Welcome to <strong>Neko-CLI</strong> üê±, your custom package manager for Node.js! Neko-CLI is
                    designed to simplify and optimize your project's dependency management, making it faster, more
                    efficient, and more secure. Whether you're initializing a new project, managing packages, or
                    keeping your codebase clean, Neko-CLI provides all the tools you need in one streamlined package. ‚ú®

                <p>
                    <strong>deps.neko</strong> is the beating heart ‚ù§Ô∏è of Neko CLI‚Äîa lock file that tracks packages
                    and their versions for each project managed. It functions as a dedicated dependency manager,
                    much like `package.json` in npm, but with a fun feline twist. Every package added
                    via Neko CLI is recorded in deps.neko, allowing you to easily manage your project's dependencies
                    with confidence.

                <h2>üì± Installing the Neko-CLI App (for iOS) via AltStore</h2>
                <p>
                    While <strong>Neko-CLI</strong> is a powerful command-line tool for Node.js project management, the <strong>Neko-CLI App for iOS</strong> (if available) would be a dedicated mobile application you might want to install on your iPhone or iPad. Since it's not an app available on the official App Store, you can install it using <strong>AltStore</strong>, a tool that allows "sideloading" of unsigned iOS applications.
                </p>

                <h3>Part 1: Installing AltStore on your iPhone/iPad</h3>
                <p>
                    To begin, you'll need a computer (Windows or macOS) and your iOS device.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Prepare your Computer:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>For Windows:</strong> Download and install the latest versions of <strong>iTunes</strong> (from Apple's website, not the Microsoft Store) and <strong>iCloud</strong>. Make sure to restart your computer after installation to ensure everything functions correctly.</li>
                            <li><strong>For macOS:</strong> Ensure <strong>iTunes</strong> (or <strong>Finder</strong>, on macOS Catalina and later) is updated.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Download AltServer:</strong> Visit the official AltStore website.

                        . Download and install <strong>AltServer</strong> for your operating system (Windows or macOS).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Launch AltServer:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>On Windows:</strong> AltServer will run in the system tray (bottom-right corner).</li>
                            <li><strong>On macOS:</strong> AltServer will appear in the menu bar (top-right corner).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Connect your iOS Device:</strong> Connect your iPhone or iPad to your computer using a USB cable. If prompted, "Trust" the computer on your device.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Install AltStore to your device:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>On Windows:</strong> Click the AltServer icon in the system tray, then "Install AltStore" and select your device.</li>
                            <li><strong>On macOS:</strong> Click the AltServer icon in the menu bar, then "Install AltStore" and select your device.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Enter your Apple ID:</strong> You'll be prompted to enter your Apple ID and password. This information is sent directly to Apple for signing purposes and is not stored by AltStore.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Check your Device:</strong> The AltStore icon should now appear on your iPhone/iPad's home screen.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Trust the Developer Profile:</strong> Before opening AltStore, go to your iOS device's settings: <code>Settings &gt; General &gt; VPN &amp; Device Management</code>. Find your Apple ID, tap it, and then tap "Trust [Your Apple ID]".
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You can now open AltStore on your device. Keep in mind that AltStore apps expire after 7 days and require you to connect to AltServer on your computer (via Wi-Fi or USB) to refresh them.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Part 2: Installing the Neko-CLI App (.ipa file) via AltStore</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Important Note:</strong> This guide assumes you have the <code>.ipa</code> file for the Neko-CLI iOS application.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Download the Neko-CLI App IPA:</strong> You can download the <code>.ipa</code> file for the Neko-CLI iOS application from this link:

                        . Save it to your iPhone/iPad (e.g., in the Files app, or download it directly on your device).
                    </li>

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Enter Apple ID (if prompted):</strong> You may be asked to re-enter your Apple ID and password.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Installation Process:</strong> AltStore will now begin installing the Neko-CLI app. This may take a few moments.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Launch Neko-CLI:</strong> Once the installation is complete, the Neko-CLI app icon will appear on your home screen. You can now launch and use it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Refresh Apps:</strong> Remember to periodically connect your iPhone/iPad to the computer running AltServer (either via USB or on the same Wi-Fi network) and open AltStore to refresh your installed apps and prevent them from expiring after 7 days. You can refresh by going to "My Apps" and tapping "Refresh All".
                    </li>
                </ol>
